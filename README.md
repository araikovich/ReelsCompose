## Architecture
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM

## Modularization
This project doesn't currently have modularization due to time constraints. However, if it were a real-life project, I would implement the following modular structure:
- app
- common
- data
- domain
- feature
- core

## Functionality
Users can scroll through an infinite list of reels, like them, and increase the count for shares. The like and share logic has been added for demonstration purposes only.
